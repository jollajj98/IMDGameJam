# IMD GameJam! Story-driven edition

Game jams are a hectic, creative explosion.    
With big dreams and a tight deadline, a team of videogame nerds join forces to create a playable prototype in just a few days.   
 Chaos ensues.

## PLANNING
Videogames are an extremely moldable medium, anything from simple but meaningful interactions to full blown parallel universes can be found down the videogame rabbithole.   
During this project week we will take inspiration from videogames to tell a playable story. Melisa and Joelle will share their passion for videogames and their experience in the field, guiding you to explore the medium through the lens of storytelling.

### 15-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storytelling and play  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Melisa)

Together, we will play a selection of games that challenge their own definition, tell stories in an immersive way and engage their players through different perspectives.
Having observed what videogames can do to us, we will envision what we want our game to do to its players. We will look into storytelling, the shapes of stories, the core emotion we want to convey.

### 16-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prototyping in Unity  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joelle)

After having explored the shapes of stories, we will learn how we can translate these shapes into game mechanics and interactions. This hands-on prototyping session will introduce you to your main tool for this week: the Unity Game Engine.

### 17-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game art creation  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Melisa)
It is now time to make something beautiful, to give that ugly Unity-default look a pretty makeover! We will dive into game art creation tools, choose a style for our game that fits our story and make our designs come to life. 

### 18-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make make make  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joelle)
Today is the big day: we put together everything we've learned and jam. The teams have the whole day to work on their games. Joelle will be your "programmer's rubberduck", the one every game developer speaks to when there's a mysterious bug infecting their code. You can refer to her for all your game jam frustrations!

### 19-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrap up & play  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Melisa & Joelle)
Time to set up the IMD arcade and play everyone's games. We will have last minute feedback and help sessions during the morning, to give you time to wrap up Thursday's chaotic sprint.
